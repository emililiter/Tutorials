    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The cocoa industry teems with certification schemes each promising to guarantee a fair livelihood for farmers while being sustainably and ethically sourced. In fact, many companies such as Nestle, Barry Callebaut, and Cargill each have their own certification schemes on top of third-party certifications such as Fairtrade, Rain Forest Alliance, and UTZ. This begs the question: just how fair is Fairtrade, et. al?\n",
    "\n",
    "If Fairtrade is all its cracked up to be, why is there a need for a company-specific sustainability scheme to meet various CSR standards? To this end, Danwatch launched an investigation into Big Cocoa in the Ivory Coast. As part of the research, we put together this map to give us an idea of what is happening on the ground. <b>We wanted to visualize Fairtrade certified producers and suppliers, suspended producers and suppliers, and the overlap (if any) with Big Cocoa.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where did we get our information?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the map below, we worked from two main sources:\n",
    "* FLOCERT Customer Search [(source)](https://www.flocert.net/about-flocert/customer-search):  FLOCERT is the certification body for Fairtrade and provides a brief record of the name, address or postal box number, and FLOCERT ID for certified and suspended producers (farms) and traders.\n",
    "* Nestle's supply chain disclosure [(source)](https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/asset-library/documents/library/documents/suppliers/supply-chain-disclosure-cocoa-cote-ivoire.pdf): Nestle discloses their Tier 1 as well as Tier 2 suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also drew upon other sources such as the [2017 Repertoire des Societes Cooperatives](http://www.agriculture.gouv.ci/uploads/Repertoire_des_soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9s_coop%C3%A9ratives_FILIERES_2017_(2).pdf) and the legal announcements section of [Abidjan.net](https://business.abidjan.net/al/) during the process of trying to locate Fairtrade farms and traders as well as trying to determine where the Nestle farms are based on the farms were referred to from. I will discuss these in detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What does the data tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the FLOCERT data, we have the names and partial addresses of farms and traders which are certified or suspended as of 21 April 2020. A rough location was logged for each farm or trader based on the partial address provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Nestle data, we can see Nestle's named Tier 1 suppliers. Tier 1 suppliers work directly with Nestle. Not surprisingly, there are several members of Big Cocoa, including Barry Callebaut, Cargill, and Blommer/Olam among Nestle's Tier 1 suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers are more interesting: these are direct suppliers to Tier 1 suppliers. As such, the Tier 2 suppliers linked directly to these Big Cocoa players must be the farms where Big Cocoa source their beans.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we put the data from both datasets together, we can start to answer the question \"Where and what are Big Cocoa's activities in the Ivory Coast?\" Though the addresses aren't exact, the FLOCERT data is useful in that it provides a glimpse into concentrated areas of farms and traders. Then, we can see if these areas overlap with Nestle's Tier 1 suppliers'activities in the Ivory Coast. Or, we can see if there are matches between the FLOCERT and Nestle farms.\n",
    "\n",
    "While FLOCERT provides a producer or trader 's name, address, and ID, Nestle only discloses its supplier's name. To flesh out the information from Nestle, I cross-referenced the names with those in the FLOCERT data and the 2017 Repertoire des Societes Cooperatives, which provides a list of Ivoirian cocoa coops, region, activities, and contact details. Since the Repertoire's information is a few years old, I also cross-referenced the legal announcements section of Abidjan.net for signs of the Nestle Tier 2 supplier in question. These legal announcements ranged from the creation of a company to other changes in the company structure. Often, these announcements also included details on the types of activities a coop engages in, such as production, collection, sales, trading, or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why make a map?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data tells us that about 12 of Nestle's Tier 2 suppliers are also Fairtrade certified *or* were Fairtrade certified but have since had their certfications suspended. (I say \"about\" because we need more information to confirm if one or two of Nestle's Tier 2 suppliers are matches for the list of Fairtrade farms.) This confirms Big Cocoa's activities in the Ivory Coast. However, the data alone does not answer the questions \"How fair is Fairtrade?\" or \"Why do companies need their own certificaton schemes if they already use Fairtrade sources?\" or \"Why aren't all of a company's suppliers Fairtrade?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To start to answer these questions and others, Danwatch needed to conduct an on-the-ground investigation. This map allowed us to visualize the spread of the farms we're interested in (farms both Nestle and Fairtrade) and begin to plan our on-the-ground reportage. Check out the rest of this investigation [here]() or keep reading below to see how we cleaned the data and generated our map."
